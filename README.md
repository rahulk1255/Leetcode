## ⚙️ Automation Workflow

This repository is maintained using an automated workflow:

1. Problem is solved on **LeetCode**
2. Solution gets **Accepted**
3. **LeetSync** automatically:
   - Pushes the solution to GitHub
   - Organizes it by difficulty
   - Generates documentation

This ensures consistency, accuracy, and clean version control.
